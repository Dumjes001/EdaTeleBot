Dear Sir/Madam,

Blockchain Technology – the Emerging Digital Age
					
We would like to hold a number of digital trainings with your staff and learners on blockchain technology. 

Blockchain is powering technological drive in this rapidly emerging Digital Age. It holds influence in all aspects of our modern society including financial system. The advent of COVID19 has made this fact very obvious.

As a blockchain company, EDA Academy has developed the School of Cryptocurrencies that focuses on empowering the society on how to utilise blockchain technology for daily profiting. 

We teach about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and NFT, which are the products of blockchain technology, and run practical sessions such as creating digital wallets, minting NFTs, transacting in cryptocurrencies, etc.

We have packages for students and staff from 13 years and above. In fact, we encourage parents and tutors to expose their children and wards to this evolving technology at their tender age so that they won’t be left behind in this emerging Digital Age. 

We are Emerging Digital Age (trade name EDA), a digital private company, duly incorporated under the South African Companies Act with company registration number, 2021/818038/07, and we have developed a number of products under a brand name EdaFace of which the School of Cryptocurrencies is one of them.
