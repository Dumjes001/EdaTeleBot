Launchpad Whitepaper

Introduction
(A). EdaFace Launchpad is a Compartment
Generally, EdaFace is made up of 9 Components. Each Component is divided into Compartments. Some
Components have just two Compartments while some others have more. 

Component 2, which is known as the Crypto Reflector, has three Compartments:
(a). Spot Exchange Platform
(b). Derivatives Exchange Platform
(c). EdaFace Launchpad.
Thus, EdaFace Launchpad is the 3rd Compartment of Component 2.

(B). Divisions of EdaFace Launchpad
Each Compartment of EdaFace is divided into sections known as Divisions. As a Compartment, EdaFace
Launchpad consists of eight Divisions:
(i). Resource Centre
(ii). Eda Token Platform
(iii). Submit Presale
(iv). Ongoing Presales
(v). Upcoming Presales
(vi). Archived Presales
(vii). Launching Platform
(viii). Staking Platform

(C). Anatomy of EdaFace Launchpad
Each of the Divisions of EdaFace is organized in such a way that it is easy to navigate and offers speedy
transactions. The structural organization of the Division is what is known as the Anatomy. Thus, the
Anatomy is the framework of EdaFace.

The following sections are the anatomical description of each of the eight divisions of EdaFace
Launchpad.

Section One: Resource Centre
This is where information about EdaFace Launchpad is available. It contains the following
information:
• FAQ about Launchpad
- What is a Launchpad
- Importance of a Launchpad
- Why You Need our Launchpad

• What are these – ICO, IEO, IDO, and STO
• How to Submit Crypto Project
• Legal Information

Note the information in this area is linked with all other resource centres of EdaFace and EDA ecosystem
as a whole. For instance, the legal information like the Disclaimers, Listing Terms and Conditions, etc.
should be read alongside with all the other legal information contained on EdaFace and EDA Ecosystem
as a whole.

Section Two: Eda Token Platform
Eda Token is abbreviated as EDA, hence, Eda Token Platform is abbreviated as EDAP.

EDAP is the 2nd Division of EdaFace Launchpad that serves the following functions:
(i). EDA Presales
The Presales of Eda Token will take place on EDAP.
(ii). Staking Function
The Dashboard of EDAP plays a role in the staking of Eda Token.
(iii). Post EDA Presales

At the end of Eda Token Presale, EDAP will serve as the platform where you can buy Eda Token for any
purpose such as to pay EdaFace fees and charges. For instance, you can buy EDA to transact on Digital
Clinic, pay for enrolment in the School of Cryptocurrencies, transact on NFT Marketplace, etc.

Smart Contract Integration via Web3
To be able to run the Presales of Eda Token on EDAP, it means Eda Token, which is a BEP20 token on
Binance Smartchain, has to be integrated into EDAP Launchpad via smart contract development and
Web3 functionalities.
The integration of Eda Token into the EdaFace Launchpad will ensure the followings:
(a). Smooth running of the 30 Presale Phases of Eda Token
(b). Smooth running of Airdrops and Bonuses
(c). Development of any other functionalities that will make EdaFace Launchpad to work effectively and
efficiently with the other parts of the entire EdaFace projects
(d). Preparation of the Launchpad for other Crypto Project to launch their Presales

The Two Sides of EDAP
Eda Token Platform has both the USER SIDE and ADMIN SIDE.5
The Admin Side of EDAP:
The Admin Side is specifically for office use.
Each phase of the Presales will run automatedly. That is, as one phase finishes, it should roll
automatedly into the next phase.
However, there will be a mechanism in which the Administrator can manually halt and resume the
process of each phase at will.
Displayed Parameters
The following parameters will be displayed in each Presale Phase:
• Total amount of token allotted for the phase
• The price of each token
• The progress of the sale – the amount sold, number of holders, etc.
• The timer that shows progress of the sale
• Any other parameter(s) as shown on the Launchpad.
Integration of Airdrops

The free airdrops will be of two kinds:
(a). Purchase Bonus:
For every purchase, the buyer will receive extra tokens at 3% of his total purchase. This should be
automated.
The total amount of tokens set aside for Purchase Bonus will be 330 billion EDA.
(b). Referral Bonus:
In addition, when you refer your family members, friends, colleagues, or anyone you will receive 10%
extra tokens for every purchase they make.
The total amount of tokens set aside for Purchase Bonus will be 1.1 trillion EDA.
Thus, the overall total amount of tokens set aside for both Purchase Bonus and Referral Bonus is:
330 billion + 1.1 trillion = 1.4 trillion EDA6
The two airdrops (Purchase Bonus and Referral Bonus) will run automatedly.

The User Side of EDAP
The User Side of the Launchpad consists of seven (7) sections:
(i). Dashboard
This is where the purchased Eda Token will be seen.
(ii). Buy Token
This is where you can buy Eda Token. It displays the amount of tokens and the bonuses you will receive
for a certain amount.
The minimum purchase required to attract the 3% Purchasing Bonus is 10 million EDA.
(iii). Transaction
This is where you will see all the transactions of your purchases.
(iv). How-to-Buy
This is where you can read and watch videos on how to buy Eda Token during the Presales.
(v). My Token
This displays the amount of tokens you have that are available for your immediate use.
(vi). Referral
This is where you will see all your referrals.
In addition, you will see your referral link, known as Referral URL, which you can send to all your
relatives, friends, colleagues, etc. to buy Eda Token.
When anyone buys with your Referral URL, you will receive 10% of the amount that the individual has
purchased.
(vii). Main Site
This division takes you to EdaFace main website.

Methodology of EDAP
The followings show how events flow through Eda Token Platform:
(a). Eda Token will be bought at the “Buy Token” area.
(b). The minimum amount of Eda Token per transaction that you can buy is 20 dollars.
(c). For each purchase, you will receive the followings:
(i). the equivalent amount of Eda Tokens that you have paid for (this is the Purchase Amount)
(ii). a 3% free bonus of Purchase Amount (this is the Purchase Bonus)
(iii). a 10% free bonus of Purchase Amount (known as Referral Bonus), which you will receive for every
purchase bought with your Referral Link
(d). All the Eda Tokens bought will be seen in the Dashboard as well as in My Token area as the Total
Token Amount.


To further enhance stability and progressive price movement, the following Lock and Release Measures
is enshrined:
(a). All the Eda Tokens bought during the ICO will be locked in the Dashboard.
(b). After the ICO, on the last day of each month, 10% of the tokens at the Dashboard will be released.
(c). The released tokens will be seen in My Token area as the Token Balance.
(d). Once released, you are free to send your tokens to any of your BEP20 wallets such as Metamask or
Trust Wallet.
In My Token area, you will see where you can add your “receiving BEP20 wallet address”.
(e). To show the Team commitment to the success of this project, note that the Team allocation will be
locked for 12 months.

Staking Methodology
You are encouraged to keep your Eda Token for a longer time in order to maximise good profits.
Remember those who kept their Bitcoins for longer period reap untold profits. The same applies with
Eda Token.9
However, unlike Bitcoin, Eda Token has the advantage of yielding more tokens for you if you stake your
tokens.
In My Token area, there is a Stake Button, where you can decide to stake your Eda Token and receive
annual 5% compounded interest. By clicking on the Stake Button, the Staking Platform will open up for
you to stake your tokens.
See the step-by-step on how to stake your Eda Token (that is, Staking Methodology) in the Staking
Platform.10

<<<>>> Submit your Project by Clicking here <<<>>>
Compliance Grading15
Please, note that your submitted Project will be assigned a Compliance Grade based on its verification
status:
(i). Prelim Verif
This initial submission will flag your Project as “Prelim Verif.” This means your submitted Project has
successfully achieved “Preliminary Verification,” which will be displayed conspicuously next to it.
(ii). Comp Verif
EDA manually checks every submitted Crypto Project listed on EdaFace. This is to ensure adherence to
EDA’s minimum safety listing requirements (MSLR) that helps to minimize crypto scams.
Once your Project passes the manual compliance, it will be flagged as “Comp Verif,” which means
“Complete Verification.”
Outcome of Compliance Grade
A Crypto Project that fails to receive “Comp Verif” will automatically be delisted from EdaFace
Launchpad platform within 30 days.
Upon submission, you will receive an automated response from EDA. Subsequently, EDA may or may not
notify you of the verification status of your submitted Project, depending on the backlog of work. It is
your responsibility to ensure correct documentations are submitted for Compliance Grade check.16

Section Seven: Launching-on-EdaFace
Launching-on-EdaFace (LOE) is the platform where you can launch your Presales on EdaFace Launchpad.
LOE is different from listing your coin or token on Ongoing Presale or Upcoming Presale Platforms.
Listing on Ongoing Presale or Upcoming Presale platform is simply to advertise your Crypto Project on
those platforms while the Presale methodology is handled by the Crypto Project or their chosen party.
On the other hand, LOE means your Crypto Project will not only advertise on EdaFace but its
methodology will also be handled on EdaFace.
The benefits you will have by selecting LOE are:

(i). EdaFace Launchpad increases EdaFace’s traffic flow, thereby increasing the visibility of Eda Token
(ii). Payment for using Eda Launchpad will be done with Eda Token
Thus, EdaFace Launchpad gives a strong use case to the Eda Token, hence, ensuring continuous increase
in the price of the token. This means you should be a long-term holder of Eda Token so as to enjoy its
continuous price appreciation.
(C). FAQ ON PRESALE
What is a Presale
A Presale is the period before a crypto coin or token is publicly listed in the Crypto Market.
What Is the Benefit of a Presale?
Because Presale is the early stage of the life of a crypto, it is often the phase when the crypto is
ridiculously cheap. Hence, those who are fortunate to buy the crypto in Presale often make substantial
profits.25
Any Risk with Presale?
Yes, the common risks are:
(i). The crypto may turn out a non-viable one, hence, you may lose your investment capital. This is why
you should always Do Your Own Research (DYOR) before buying a Presale.
(ii). The crypto project may be a scam. In fact, there are many scams in the Crypto Market, hence,
always DYOR.
EdaFace Launchpad seeks to eliminate such crypto scams, but it is your responsibility to always Do Your
Own Research before buying any Presale.
Are there Different Types of Presale?
Yes, there are. As the Crypto Markets evolves, a number of different innovative methods of Presales
keep surfacing. Here are the popular Presale types:
(i). Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
This is the first type of Presale to appear in the Crypto Market. It refers to the method of raising funds
for a Crypto Project that seeks to enter the Crypto Market for the first time by selling some of the
cryptos at a massively discounted price.
ICO is very similar to Initial Public Offering (IPO), which is used by companies to raise money from stock
exchanges.
(ii). Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)
This is when a Presale takes place on a centralized exchange (Cex) such as Binance Exchange. The
involvement of Cex makes some clients to believe IEO offers additional safety to the Presale.
(iii). Initial Dex Offering (IDO)
This is when a Presale takes place on a decentralized exchange (Dex) such as Pancakeswap.
(iv). Security Token Offering (STO)
This is different from ICO, IEO or IDO in that it involves selling a tokenized digital security.
STOs are susceptible to regulation and thus represent a more secure investment alternative than other
Presales.
EdaFace Launchpad does not presently support STO.26
Divisions of EdaFace Launchpad
EdaFace Launchpad consists of seven Divisions:
(i). Eda Token Platform (EDAP)
This is where Eda Token can be bought.

the commencement date has reached, the Presale will automatically move onto the Ongoing Presales
platform or to the LOE platform.
(v). Archived Presales
This is the platform that display past Presales, which refer to Crypto Projects that have successfully
concluded their presales.
(vi). Launching Platform
This is Launching-on-EdaFace (LOE) platform, which means your Crypto Project will not only be
advertised on EdaFace Launchpad but its methodology will also take place on EdaFace Launchpad, thus,
taking the burden of building, buying, hiring, or struggling for a platform to launch your Presale off your
shoulders so that you can concentrate on your project marketing and product development.27

Please, note that your submitted Project will be assigned a Compliance Grade based on its verification
status:

(ii). Comp Verif
EDA manually checks every submitted Crypto Project listed on EdaFace. This is to ensure adherence to
EDA’s minimum safety listing requirements (MSLR) that helps to minimize crypto scams.36
Once your Project passes the manual compliance, it will be flagged as “Comp Verif,” which means
“Complete Verification.”

A Crypto Project that fails to receive “Comp Verif” will automatically be delisted from EdaFace
Launchpad platform within 30 days.
Upon submission, you will receive an automated response from EDA. Subsequently, EDA may or may not

methodology will take place on EdaFace.

The benefits you will have by selecting LOE are:
• you won’t need to build, buy, hire, or struggle for a platform to launch your Presale since EdaFace
Launchpad provides you with one
• frees your time to concentrate on marketing and developing your Project while EdaFace Launchpad
takes care of the Presale stages for you.
• at the end of your Presale, your Project will be listed on EdaFace Crypto Reflector, and that exposes
your Project to thousands of users across the world.
• you will receive 25% discounted amount for listing on EdaFace Crypto Reflector.
