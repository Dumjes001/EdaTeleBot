EdaFace Conceptualization

On 12th May 2022, EDA as a company was inaugurated in line with the divine direction received by Captain Adiari that started as far back as on 12th May 1996. Subsequently, EDA has been successfully registered in South Africa as a private limited company. EDA is the acronym for Emerging Digital Age. 

EdaFace Aggregator, the first product of EDA, was a divine conceptualisation that came into Captain Adiari's heart while praying on 11th June 2021 and became fully apparent by 5th September 2021. By 6th September 2021, Captain started to assemble a Team and the following day started drawing up the lightpaper. By October 2021, initial fund raising was carried out.

By January 2022, EdaFace website was developed, and by April 2022, Eda Token was created as the native utility token for the aggregator. 
Finally, on 12th May 2022, the Initial Coin Offer (ICO) of Eda Token was officially started.
