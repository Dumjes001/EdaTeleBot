Eda Aggregator Conceptualization						5th September 2021
The idea of EDA Aggregator came into Captain’s heart on 11th June 2021 while praying, hence, it is of God. 
On 6th August 2021, Captain met with the IT guy, Kola, who built the Digital Clinic App to discuss the EDA Aggregator. 
But Kola claimed he was interested though not showing strong commitment. Hence, Captain started praying for direction from God.
On Sunday 5th September 2021, while doing routine exercises at 7 to 8.45pm, Captain started receiving an illumination to contact Bro. Peter at Port Elizabeth for IT recommendation.
On 6th September 2021, Bro. Peter was contacted on phone, who immediately recommended Tony as the IT.
On 6th September 2021, a conference call meeting between Captain, Peter and Tony was held from 17.26pm to 18.46pm to discuss the IT component of EDA Aggregator. Another meeting was scheduled for the next day.
On 7th September 2021, Captain met with Patricia and Victoria, EDA partners, at 10 am to 15.30pm, to discuss and pray about the EDA Aggregator. It was a Teusday, which is usually praying/fasting day for EDA partners. 
On 7th September 2021, 7.30pm to 8.33pm, a digital conference meeting via Team platform was held between Captain, Tony, Peter, Patricia, and Victoria to discuss the EDA Aggregator.
