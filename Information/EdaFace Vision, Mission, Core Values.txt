Five Points about Logo
(1). The Logo has 6 borders, representing the 6 continents of the world that EdaFace is meant to service. The 6 continents of the world are Africa, America (consists of North, Central and South), Antartica, Asia, Europe, and Oceania (comprises mostly Australia and New Zealand).

(2). Each of the 6 borders of the logo are linked to each other, representing EdaFace linking the crypto services across all the continents of the world.

(3). Notice that some of the borders are shorter than some, representing the different population densities of the different continents, and EdaFace will service all, the population density and peculiarities notwithstanding.

(4). There is a complex network of connectivity within the logo borders, representing the complex nature of Crypto money, which EdaFace aims to demystify.

(5). There is more than one opening into the logo on the borders, depicting the different services EdaFace is meant to provide through many outlets like Reflectors, Eda Plantation, Digital Mall, Metaverse, Scam Verification, Digital Clinic, etc. with no central interference – that is true decentalisation, which is the key characteristic of EdaFace.
