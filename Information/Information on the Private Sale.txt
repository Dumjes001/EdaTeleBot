Good morning, Guys.

I know many people here have never been involved in a crypto Private Sale (also called Seed Phase).

A Private Sale often occurs before the Official Launching of a ICO Presales.

In other words, Private Sale is a Pre-Launch period. It has one main advantage for the Project – helps to testrun the Project for the upcoming Launching.

A private sale is for individual people who will trust the system enough to start with it from the very beginning. Hence, most people that get involved in Private Sales are family members, friends, colleagues, and key investors. These people often know the Project Team, hence, put trust in the Project. 

Such trust receives good compensation for the time, energy and resource commitment. Indeed, Private Sales are when you can be early bird and reap all the benefits.

In other words, EdaFace Private Sale is a Pre-Launch. The Launching is when the entire Crypto Market will be informed and the Launchpad will be fully activated.

EdaFace Private Sale starts today by 17H00 (Pretoria Time).

Hi Guys,

Today, we’ve started a good journey – EdaFace Private Sale!

You may think Eda Token may be a shitcoin. If you think so, in 6 months from now, you’ll regret not acquiring the token massively now that you have the opportunity!

We have the marketing strategy all laid out. We have actually contracted professional marketers.

For instance, our Newsletters that target major news media with millions of readers are ready. They’ve been paid for.

Some influencers in Africa have been contracted already to sing EdaFace.

Our video marketing, social media marketing, etc. are all pouring in marketing products.

EdaFace itself is unique with good utility cases. Hence, Eda Token is not a memecoin!

But I want to keep to my promise of letting the guys and ladies here on all EDA Platform as well as our MCD Platforms to be partakers of this movement, which is the first of its kind from Africa!

As such, we’ve halted any form of marketing and concentrate on EDA and MCD members for the next couple of days.

Private Sale is targeting EDA and MCD people. Don’t miss out!

In fact, I’ve started to migrate those that I can on the various EDA and MCD platforms to EdaFace in order to forestall duplicate postings.

If I couldn’t migrate you to EdaFace Telegram platform, you can join by clicking here … https://t.me/edaface

Hi Guys.
We are building a Crypto Project, EdaFace, the first of its kind in Africa. Eda Token is its native token. It is in Private Sale now. This means you have an opportunity of acquiring this token now that it’s very cheap.

DO NOT BUY on the Launchpad. The Launchpad will only be activated once the ICO Presale starts.

The ongoing Private Sale is actually a Pre-Launch!

Welcome to EdaFace, “Bringing Financial Freedom.”

Regards.
EDA Team.

The Steps on How to Buy the Private Sale start with Registration on EdaFace Launchpad.

Thereafter, you copy the EdaFace wallet address provided and make payment into it. Then you send the transaction hash and your email address to the provided email.

You may wonder why you shouldn’t buy everything on the Launchpad during this Private Sale?

The answer is that Private Sales are often pre-launch sales. Hence, smart contracts are not often built into Launchpads to handle such sales. 

Once the ICO Presales of Eda Token are launched, the Launchpad will be activated and all its functions with its inbuilt smart contracts will be live.

Therefore, to get involve with the Presales and reap the enormous benefits, follow the steps outlined here on the platform.

Hope this explanation answers the question of many people.

Good morning, Nolwazi.
After we spoke yesterday, your phone went voicemail.

If you don’t want to do a thing, what professionals do is to let the other person know. Switching off your phone is disrespecting the other partner and it won’t allow you to grow.

Please, if you’re interested in shooting the video today, let us know.
