Structural Arrangement of the Utilities

The utilities of Eda Token are collectively arranged to form EdaFace, which is a user interface aggregator that brings all the various functionalities of the crypto industry onto a single platform!

The structure of EdaFace is methodologically arranged into four (4) levels:

Level 1: Components
EdaFace is made up of nine (9) Components:
Component 1: Crypto Reflector
Component 2: Centralized Exchange Reflector
Component 3: Decentralized Exchange Reflector
Component 4: Crypto Verification Centre 
Component 5: NFT Marketplace
Component 6: Digital Literature Reflector
Component 7: EdaFace Digital Mall
Component 8: EdaFace Academy
Component 9: Digital Clinic 


Level 2: Compartments
Each Component is divided into Compartments. Some Components have just two Compartments while some others have up to four (4) or more Compartments. Collectively, there are 30 Compartments.

Level 3: Divisions
Each Compartment is further divided into Divisions. There may be two or more Divisions for each Compartment.

Level 4: Anatomy
Each Division is organized in such a way that it is easy to navigate and offers speedy transactions. The structural organization of the Division is what is known as the Anatomy. Thus, the Anatomy is the framework of EdaFace.

Mnemonic
You can easily remember the EdaFace structure with this simple mnemonic: CCDA:
C = Components
C = Compartments
D = Divisions
A = Anatomy



Section Three:
Brief Description of EdaFace Nine Components

Component 1: Crypto Reflector
This is where you will see all the listed cryptocurrencies. Presently, about 13 000 cryptocurrencies are listed on EdaFace, and the number keeps increasing. In addition, you will see the trending cryptos in real time and be able to buy and sell cryptos via the Peer-to-Peer Platform.

Project developers can list their cryptos and/or advertise their crypto projects via EdaFace Component 1.

Component 2: Centralized Exchange Reflector
This is where you will see all the listed centralized exchanges (Cex) offering spot and futures (derivatives) trading services.

Presently, there are more than 400 Cex that are listed on EdaFace, and the number keeps increasing. In addition, this component has a Launchpad where you can view and join Ongoing, Upcoming, and Past Presales (ICO, IDO, IEO, STO, etc.).

Project developers can list their Cex and/or launch their Presales via EdaFace’s Component 2.

Component 3: Decentralized Exchange Reflector
Here, you will see all the listed decentralized exchanges (Dex). Presently, there are more than 100 Dex that are listed on EdaFace, and the number keeps increasing. Here you can swap, stake, farm, and provide liquidity pairs to various pools.

In addition, Project developers can list their Dex and/or create pools for their coins and tokens. This is one of the beauties of EdaFace.

Component 4: Crypto Verification Centre 
Another beautiful thing about EdaFace is that it does identify crypto scams via its Crypto Verification Centre, especially rug pulls, long before they occur. In other words, EdaFace helps all crypto lovers to avoid scams. This is the first of its kind in the crypto industry.

Also, you can track down any crypto on its blockchain via the Blockchain Ecosystem of EdaFace’s Component 4. You can check how to use this essential feature on “How to Use EdaFace.”

Component 5: NFT Marketplace
This is where all the three kinds of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – fine arts, collectibles, and gaming NFTs –are displayed. Also, NFTs can be minted and traded here.



In addition, you can monitor and join the Metaverse world from here. Presently, there are more than 150 metaverse projects that are listed on EdaFace, and the number keeps increasing.

Component 6: Digital Literature Reflector
This is where digital literatures will be listed and traded. Digital literatures include digital books, digital songs, and digital plays, e.g., poetry, movies, dramas, etc. The interesting thing about this component is that anyone can list their digital literature and/or use EdaFace’s services to produce his digital literature. Indeed, it is one of the uniqueness of EdaFace.

Component 7: EdaFace Digital Mall
This component is another unique feature of EdaFace. It is an e-commerce platform where you can buy and sell goods and services over the internet. Employers and employees can advertise their products and services via this component. Indeed, EdaFace Digital Mall connects the physical world to the digital world.

Component 8: EdaFace Academy
Education is key to success. EdaFace through its Academy offers the School of Cryptocurrencies, which will empower you with appropriate, skilled knowledge of the crypto industry that will enable you to accelerate your wealth via crypto investment.

In addition, this component through its EdaFace Newsfeed offers news on current affairs in the crypto industry and in the digital world in general. The news is constantly updating to keep users timely informed.

Component 9: Digital Clinic 
This is an application that seeks to digitalize the healthcare system in Africa and beyond. It reduces patient waiting time in both private and public health facilities, ensures healthcare practitioners’ accountability, monitors healthcare delivery efficiency, and discourages abuse of the healthcare system.

By these activities, the Digital Clinic of EDA helps to strengthen the healthcare system in Africa and beyond. It is indeed an innovative pioneer of healthcare delivery in this part of the world!



Section Four: 
EdaFace Infrastructure Development

Eda Token derives its utilities from the functionalities of EdaFace structures. EdaFace itself is a well-thought-out project. The infrastructure development of EdaFace’s 9 Components is organized into phases. 

Below is the summary of the infrastructure development of EdaFace:

Phase One Infrastructure Development:
This Phase consists of construction of Components 1 to 4. Thus far, the followings have been built and launched:

Component 1:
(i). Crypto Listing Platform
(ii). Crypto Trending Platform
(iii). Advertisement Platform
(iv). Peer-to-Peer Trading Platform – still undergoing development.

Component 2:
(a). Spot Exchange Platform
(b). Derivatives Exchange Platform 

(c). EdaFace Launchpad 
The Launchpad consists of seven Divisions with a Resource Centre. All the seven divisions of EdaFace Launchpad have been built and available for the public. 

The seven Divisions are: 
(i). Eda Token Platform
(ii). Submit Presale
(iii). Ongoing Presales
(iv). Upcoming Presales
(v). Archived Presales
(vi). Launching Platform
(vii). Staking Platform

The unique features of EdaFace Launchpad include:
(a). Crypto Projects can list their Presales (ICO, IEO, etc.) on the platform

(b). Crypto Projects can also launch their projects on the launchpad. Hence, they do not need to look for a platform or spend money to build one.


(c). All crypto projects that will be listed or launched on EdaFace Launchpad will pass the preliminary verification stage, and will receive Prelim Verif status, and should within one month be completely verified to receive the status of Comp Verif. 

Any crypto project that fails the basic verification requirements (that is, Prelim Verif) will not be able to list or launch on EdaFace Launchpad. 

The reason for this is to prevent scam projects from listing and launching on EdaFace Launchpad. This is in keeping with one of the main objectives of EdaFace, which is to fight crypto scams and give users value for their investment.

(d). The interesting about listing and launching on EdaFace Launchpad is that it is completely decentralized. That is, no centralized authority controls the listing and launching. 

Despite that it is decentralized, the platform still has a system that detects scam projects. This is unique, first of its kind in the entire crypto industry! 

Component 3
The following Compartments of Component 3 have been built:
(a). Dex Listing Platform 
(b). Eda Plantation – construction is moved to Phase 3 Development due to its advanced security and technicality. 

Note that currently over 13400 cryptos and about 600 exchanges (spots, derivatives and dex) running on EdaFace platform. EDA is investing heavily on its Application Programming Interfaces in order to capture the dynamic changes in the Crypto Market in real time. 

Indeed, presently EdaFace has the highest number of exchanges running on a crypto platform, and the third (the other two are Coinmarketcap and Coingecko) in the Crypto Market to have such varieties of cryptos and exchanges.

Component 4
The following Compartments of Component 4 are in their construction stages:
(a). Rugpull Detection Centre 
(b). Blockchain Ecosystem
Their beta testing should be ready within three months.


Phase Two Infrastructure Development: 
This is the next phase of EdaFace projects. It consists of construction of Components 5 to 9.

Component 5: NFT Marketplace Construction
The unique EdaFace NFT Marketplace has been built and it is now in its testnet version. Mainnet will soon be released for the public.

Component 6: Literature Marketplace Construction
This Component is ultimately linked to the Digital Mall, hence, its construction is structured into the developmental stages of EdaFace Digital Mall. See the Road Map for its construction timeline.

Component 7: Digital Mall
Development is divided into Four Stages. The first stage will be launched in March 2023.

Component 8: EDA Academy
EdaFace Academy is made up of EdaFace Newsfeed and the School of Cryptocurrencies.

EdaFace Newsfeed has been built and launched to update users regularly and in real time of all the crypto news and development in the blockchain industry and the digital world in general as the news unfold in the digital space.

EdaFace School of Cryptocurencies, which provides guidance on how users can generate, maximise, and accelerate their cryptocurrency investments, has been built and it is presently in testnet.

Component 9: Digital Clinic – partially ready for launching.


Phase Three Infrastructure Development: 
This involves development of Eda Blockchain. Details will be unveiled in due course



Section Five: 
Characteristics of Eda Token

Eda Token has the following characteristics that make it very unique:

(a). Anti-dumping Transaction Fee
10% transaction fee to deter dumping will be applied for each sell. This 10% fee will be distributed via the following mechanisms that will ensure not only continuous price growth but also continuous increase in the number of tokens in the holders’ wallets.

(b). Holder’s Incentive Mechanisms
For holding Eda Token, you’ll enjoy not only continuous increase in the number of the token in your wallets, but also increase in LP liquidity for your trading. T

This is because of the following mechanisms that have been built into Eda Token:
• Distribution to Holders: 2% of anti-dumping transaction fee
• Distribution to LP: 1% of anti-dumping transaction fee
• Referral Bonus for Referrer: 10% of referee’s purchase
• Purchase Bonus for Buyer: 3% of every purchase 

(c). Hyper-Deflationary Mechanisms
Eda Token is hyper-deflationary, which means the amount of tokens in circulation will progressively decrease over time. This will enhance continuous price growth. 

The hyper-deflationary mechanisms built into Eda Token are as follows:
• Continuous Token Burning: 4% of anti-dumping transaction fee
• Periodical Automatic BuyBack: 1% of anti-dumping transaction fee
• Marketing: 2% of anti-dumping transaction fee

(d). Anti-Whale Mechanisms
We encourage everyone to hold Eda Token for a long time in order to enjoy immense growth benefits but discourage massive dumping of the token. 

To ensure these, the following mechanisms are built into Eda Token:
• Maximum Holding per Wallet: 0.5% of Total Supply
• Maximum Sell per Transaction: 0.1% of Total Supply



Section Six: 
Stakability

Another benefit you get from Eda Token is that you can stake your tokens and enjoy a growth rate of 5% annual percentage yield (APY).


Staking Liquidity Supply (LS)

Maximum Token for Staking = Maximum Supply – Burnt at Listing
			        = 100 trillion – 40 trillion = 60 trillion
The following calculations presume that all 60 trillion will be staked.

Interest in the 1st year at 5% APY for 60 trillion staked = 0.05 x 60 trillion = 3 trillion

Thus, Principal for the 2nd year: 60 trillion + 3 trillion = 63 trillion
Interest for 2nd year at 5% APY = 63 trillion x 0.05 = 3.15 trillion

Therefore, Principal for the 3rd year: 63 trillion + 3.15 trillion = 66.15 trillion
Interest for 3rd year at 5% APY = 66.15 trillion x 0.05 = 3.3075 trillion

Hence, total compounded interest for 3 years at 5% APY = (3+3.15+3.3075) trillion = 9.4575 trillion.

In summary, what these calculations imply is that by staking your Eda Token you’ll be receiving a compounded yield of 5% APY.


Lock and Release Measures

To further enhance stability and progressive price movement, the following Lock and Release Measures will be effected:
(a). Team allocation will be locked for 12 months
(b). Monthly release of 10% per wallet per month for ICO purchases
Again, note that these measures are designed to protect and stabilize the value of Eda Token, and enhance its price appreciation, thereby rewarding long term holders.



Section Seven: 
ICO Details

Fund Raising target
Softcap = 500 BNB = 200 000 USD (at 1BNB = 400 USD)
Hardcap = 126 142 BNB = 50 456 800 USD (at 1BNB = 400 USD)

Presale Phases
There will be 30 Phases of Presales.
Starting Presale Price: 0.000 000 5 USD
Last Presale Price: 0.000 008 USD

Total token allocation for each Presale Phase is shown in Tables 3(A), 3(B), and 3(C).
The target generated funds for each Presale Phase are shown in Table 1.

Minimum Buy = 0.05 BNB = 20 USD (at 400 USD per BNB)
Maximum Buy = 50 BNB = 20 000 USD (at 400 USD per BNB)

Section Eight: 
Airdrops and Bonuses

The free airdrops will be of two kinds:
(a). Purchase Bonus:
For every purchase, the buyer will receive extra tokens at 3% of his total purchase.

(b). Referral Bonus:
In addition, when you refer your family members, friends, colleagues, or anyone you will receive 10% extra tokens for every purchase they make.

Unsold Tokens
If there are any unsold tokens at the end of the ICO sales, the following will apply:
• 40% of unsold tokens will be burnt
• 30% of unsold tokens will be added to liquidity
• 30% of unsold tokens will go for marketing.

Target Listing Price
Softcap of 500 BNB will be used to add liquidity in Pancakeswap
500 BNB = 200 000 dollars (at 1 BNB = 400 dollars)
Initial Liquidity supply for trading = 22 000 000 000 EDA
Thus, Listing price of Eda Token: 200 000 ÷ 22 000 000 000 = 0.000 009 dollar.
