Infrastructure Development

EdaFace is a well-thought-out project. The infrastructure development of EdaFace’s 9 Components is structured into phases. Below is the summary:

Phase One Infrastructure Development:
This Phase consists of construction of Components 1 to 4. Thus far, the followings have been built and launched:

Component 1:
The Compartments of Component 1 that have been built and/or launched are:
(i). Crypto Listing Platform
(ii). Crypto Trending Platform
(iii). Advertisement Platform
(iv). Peer-to-Peer Trading Platform – still undergoing development.

Component 2:
The following Compartments of Component 2 have been built and/or launched:
(a). Spot Exchange Platform
(b). Derivatives Exchange Platform 

(c). EdaFace Launchpad 
The Launchpad consists of seven Divisions with a Resource Centre. The seven Divisions are: 
(i). Eda Token Platform
(ii). Submit Presale
(iii). Ongoing Presales
(iv). Upcoming Presales
(v). Archived Presales
(vi). Launching Platform
(vii). Staking Platform

All the seven divisions of EdaFace Launchpad have been built and available for the public. 

The uniqueness of EdaFace Launchpad are:
(a). Crypto Projects can list their Presales (ICO, IEO, etc.) on the platform

(b). Crypto Projects can also launch their projects on the launchpad. Hence, they do not need to look for a platform or spend money to build one.

(c). All crypto projects that will be listed or launched on EdaFace Launchpad will pass the preliminary verification stage, and will receive Prelim Verif status, and should within one month be completely verified to receive the status of Comp Verif. 

Any crypto project that fails the basic verification requirements (that is, Prelim Verif) will not be able to list or launch on EdaFace Launchpad. 

The reason for this is to prevent scam projects from listing and launching on EdaFace Launchpad. This is in keeping with one of the main objectives of EdaFace, which is to fight crypto scams and give users value for their investment.

(d). The interesting thing about listing and launching on EdaFace Launchpad is that it is completely decentralized. That is, no centralized authority controls the listing and launching. 

Despite that it is decentralized, the platform still has a system that detects scam projects. This is unique, first of its kind in the entire crypto industry! 

Component 3
The following Compartments of Component 2 have been built and/or launched:
(a). Dex Listing Platform 
(b). Eda Plantation – construction is moved to Phase 3 Development due to advanced security and technicality 

Note that currently over 13400 cryptos and about 600 exchanges (spots, derivatives and dex) running on EdaFace platform. EDA Holdings is investing heavily on Application Programming Interfaces in order to capture the dynamic changes in the Crypto Market in real time. 

Indeed, presently EdaFace has the highest number of exchanges running on a crypto platform, and the third (the other two are Coinmarketcap and Coingecko) in the Crypto Market to have such varieties of cryptos and exchanges.

Component 4
The following Compartments of Component 4 are in their construction stages:
(a). Rugpull Detection Centre 
(b). Blockchain Ecosystem
Their beta testing should be ready within three months.

Phase Two Infrastructure Development: 
This is the next phase of EdaFace projects. It consists of:

Component 5: NFT Marketplace – it has been deployed in mainet for the public to start using.

Component 6: Literature Marketplace – whitepaper under construction

Component 7: Digital Mall – Phase 1 Development has been completed and Phase 2 has started.

Component 8: EdaFace Academy – this has been completed, and it consists of:
(a). EdaFace School of Cryptocurrencies
(b). EdaFace Newsfeed
(c). EdaFace Forum
(d). EdaFace Tutor.

Component 9: Digital Clinic – partially ready for launching.

Phase Three Infrastructure Development: 
This involves development of Eda Blockchain. Details will be unveiled in due course.

Phase Four Infrastructure Development: 
This involves development of Eda Bank. Details will be unveiled in due course.
